1.  The command to list all Docker networks available on the system is `docker network ls`.
2.  The three default networks that come with Docker are: `bridge`, `host`, and `none`.
3.  The `docker network inspect` command provides detailed information about a network, including connected containers and their IP addresses.
4.  The most common drivers used when creating a new Docker network are: `bridge` (default), `host`, and `overlay`.
5.  The command to remove a Docker network is `docker network rm`.
6.  To connect an existing container to a specific network, the command is `docker network connect`.
7.  The command to start a container with a specified network is `docker run --network= -d`.
8.  You can check a container's network configuration, including its IP addresses, using the command `docker inspect`.
9.  Containers can communicate with each other within the same Docker network using container names instead of IPs. The command used for this communication is `ping`.
10. To demonstrate container communication using Docker DNS:
    *   Step 1: Create a Docker Network.
    *   Step 2: Start the First Ubuntu Container (Server) and start a Netcat listener on port 1234.
    *   Step 3: Start the Second Ubuntu Container (Client).
    *   Step 4: Verify the Message on the Server."
